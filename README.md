> 
The motivation behind this project is to use CRISP-DM methodology to carryout an analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survery Data analysis with the aim of uncovering answers to the following crucial questions:
* What is the programming language of choice?
* What's the pay for developers like?
* What is the framework of choice for developers?

## Summary of the results
In this notebook, we loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. We visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. We used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And we discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.



## Data and Code
* The main analysis is contained in the Super-Bowl-Data-Analysis.ipynb jupyter notebook. All the functions and code, as well as the rationale behind decisions taken is contained in this notebook.


## Prerequisites
* Numpy
* Pandas
* seaborn
* Matplotlib

Jupyter notebook and python 3.6 are needed to run the notebooks and python scripts.

## Instructions on running the application
1. Download the required data sets and if required modify the directory paths.
